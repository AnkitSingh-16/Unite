# Unite
The Unite Web Application is a user-friendly tool that simplifies the process of merging multiple PDF files. With its intuitive interface, users can easily select PDF files, and then merge them into a single, coherent document. The application leverages Node.js and Express.js on the server-side, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript handle the client-side functionalities.
